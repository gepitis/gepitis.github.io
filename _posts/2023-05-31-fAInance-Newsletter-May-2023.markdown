## ML for Finance/Quant:
 <details><summary><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01505">Beyond Classification: Financial Reasoning in State-of-the-Art Language Models</a></summary>This research explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) with 100 billion or more parameters in the financial domain. The study demonstrates that LLMs with 6B parameters or more, combined with instruction-tuning and larger datasets, exhibit the ability to generate coherent financial reasoning, contributing to the understanding of the efficacy of language models in the field of finance and investment decision-making.</details>
 <details><summary><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022199623000594">Credit growth, the yield curve and financial crisis prediction: Evidence from a machine learning approachâ˜†</a></summary>The paper develops early warning models for financial crisis prediction using machine learning on macrofinancial data for 17 countries from 1870 to 2016. Machine learning models outperform traditional regression in forecasting crises, and credit growth and the slope of the yield curve (both domestically and globally) are identified as the most crucial predictors. The study's unique approach using the Shapley value framework provides economic insights and interprets the complex relationships between predictors and crisis risk.</details>
 <details><summary><a href="https://www.cell.com/heliyon/pdf/S2405-8440(23)03362-5.pdf">Optimization of investment strategies through machine learning</a></summary>This research endeavors to devise an advanced and sustainable stock quantitative investing model, employing a fusion of Machine Learning techniques and Economic Value-Added methodologies to optimize investment strategies, with a focus on quantitative stock selection through principal component analysis and economic value-added criteria, and algorithmic trading utilizing Moving Average Convergence, Stochastic Indicators, and Long-Short Term Memory, achieving superior forecasting accuracy with LSTM networks and outperforming the market by generating considerable returns, thus proving its viability for rational and profitable investing in various market situations. </details>
